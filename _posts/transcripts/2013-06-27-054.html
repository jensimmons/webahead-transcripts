This is the Web Ahread, a weekly conversation about changing technology and the future of the web. I am your host Jen Simmons's and this is episode 54. I want to say first thank you so much to the sponsor of today's show, Environment for Human's CSS Summit. CSS Summit 2013 is a three-day online conference that's coming up in July. I'll talk more about that later. So today I thought we can talk about Jekyll. Jeykll's a word that I started hearing more more floating around in the universe, the web design development universe, and like many things you know you hear about this that and the other, there's 20,000 tools coming out all the time but for some reason it kept coming up and more and more people I really respect Really have learned a lot fromSpecial when it comes to best practices website and you know how you make a big enterprise website honey make website or website with a lot of content. Or Mark he was looking at this website calledAt home I'm out of Africa's but I just thought this might be a good time to talk about not just this one particular tool but also

all these issues that raises around how do we make a website like what's the technology platform underneath behind-the-scenes that actually creates the HML pagesHow does that happenWe've been doing in a certain way for a while and maybeIt's not the originally started out in a different way but maybe nowThere's a third way or fifth way whatever this is never to start seeing use more more moreReally getting away from using a database to store content and storing content and filesSo I'm always looking forTop is right person can talk about thisJust looks like I'll seeThem to the shop in DCThat young Honsa show I am drunk

It on the seat is the shop in DC that I met On the some on the show. Hey Young

Hey Jen

And other folks from Development Seed several years ago at DrupalconAll working in the Drupal space of the time and I was just so blown away by how smart you guys all areJust like smart so you've been doing a lot of workaroundsUs issue of moving away from content and databases and big heavy CMS is into content stored in filesSo I thoughtI paying you all and you've brought along with youDaveco home I

Dave hey Jen how are you?

If feels like every time I'm googling something about Jekyll there's a blog post and it's written by you so

Yeah we're trying to put as much of our install process out of the web talking about documentation for doing

Yeah so I'm just I'm still talking about what is Jekyll and what is it that you've been doing. Moving away from CMS database storage content/Drupal onto what you doing now.

yeah it's a great time for the conversation we just relaunched healthcare.gov which is the government signature website for information about the Affordable Care Act and how people get prepared to get new affordable insurance plans coming online again this year so it's traditional content heavy site about 1200 posts andHas all the latest features that look for a lot of sites such as Boston sign making sure that there's an interactive components such asInternet information get customer results back so have a typical project want to go out in a different way to use this is kind of a custom projects to gets tested out a lot of static website methodology that were doing so very simply what this means is you take the content and the layout and you keep it separate in separate files but you don't put anything into the database he don't build any application that you just run a program that takes that content and checks into your layout template files and then generate static HTMLOr can generate JSON or javascripYeaht whatever static component you want but in the process have a folder that contains everything you need to run your website served from a standard Web server.

And in some ways it feels like a return back to what the web started out as in the web when this first invented there was SCSS there was no JavaScript you made HTML files and if you had one webpage you had one file. one actual physical file on the hard drive. Get 27 webpages of toys and files on hard driveFirst I'm assuming me to have another tools became around especially Dreamweaver anything for sort of the stack the Dreamweaver came with front pageFor the windows world it wasn't contribute it was I forget the name of that the system that ran that sort ofData high-end Drupal I mean Dreamweaver kind of file management stuff so there's this whole sort of I don't know five years or somethingMore and more complex tools to manage one to one file see you had one main page 1151 webpage one withAnd then we moved into a world of like what he's a CMS looks store all this content in the database let's have robots running in the background and Emerson time person types the URL of their going to my fabulous website.com/about there's not actually a file there there's a robot there waiting and when youWhen the robot gets the URL then it says I need to build this page for you and it runs off to get some information from all the different places with the content of the database typically more more frequently gets a whole bunch of different pieces of content of different part of the database until the directions about what's messaging bills the page and sends it to the person who requested the userAnd some ways it's awesome because you can have all kinds of different interfaces for putting content into the database and you canContact me changing constantly people keep making comments also it's always different the page could do after the system knows who the user is like you go to Amazon.com and doesn't mean it says here's oh you buy this book last week may go buy this book are you going to dog sit and she'll ask the dogs dynamically generated per person but then the bad side of that is you can melt the server you have a lot of traffic

And if hunters of thousands of people are hating website at the same timeThen the robot have to build up 800,000s of times per minute so we kind of hit in my rambling history of the evolution of web technology and kind of handling it thereA lot of people at them and doing meanwhile is okay looks at me to cash things we need to not build this page every time user has the site so let's set up man Cashen by Nash had just turning: the weather had an absolutely sexy talk to servers all the different tools all the different things he might have said you canSo that your webpage gets built wants and then you have than 1000 people visit many gets built again thousand people does that version of itTinsley can handle a contract but then what you guys are talking about you like a sort of the third thing is so much going back to the first thing it's more taking I think although I want to ask you taking the best practices rubble learnings from the first two phases and sorted inventing a new system where the content is being stored in files and the files are getting built once and then it is many millions of times is one butThere's still a couple get the system to build those files my content candy separate from the structure of thatVisual slam that content and you can have some of the best practices we've developed where you keeping separate and you don't mix the way something is presented with the thing itself

That's right you Possessing writingYeah I think that's pretty good description of what's going on I thinkTo be clear we are not inventors of JekyllDo you think it's been around for long timeBut we custom across as we were looking again how does a really useful tool for case collaboration one of the things thatTom Preston Warner one of dollars and can I was doing was he was running his blog off of get you saying oh I use get to manage my code and clobbered with other people and code and for developers sources like one of the mainOutputs of all your creative energy is Côte right so you think of a writer writing articles and posts for coders they may blog once in a while but the main grid about put his code so get have developed all these incredible tools aroundWriting code right you can comment on specific lines of code great issues to track your actions milestonesWhenever you change when your files and get you can comment in an attempt to change you can rollback or branch your plaza Tori to start testing out a completely new idea on your codeAnd so what he did was he said wellOne long sometimes and I'm finding that sort ofI kind of want to do the same sorts of things on my blog but I do run my code I want to test a new formatOr like a new style of writing maybe I want to critter branch and just experiment with that and my branchOr if I want to know highlight some important lines in my introduction and sort of comment on that and let someone elseSo give me female on that I want to be able to do that soI think there's been a shift of the past couple years not only has there've been a lot of adoption of get version control systemPeople taking a lot of inspiration they summit pools I could have built around their get for not this code management just in general is a platform for collaborating around contentSo you explain whyPerhaps a simple sentence with Jekyll for a blog for instanceFerguson does no code and getWhat are people typically do it like how does it work sure so lets just start for the ground up what you do is you create a post directory crate folder and you put the sort of content you want in your blog there so you blog post that you want to write would be a single file and in that file you canReally use whateverFormat of writing you prefer unless the missing people prefer markdown see right your post and send markdown at the top of the file there's a section where you can basically as edited your post and it's basically in YAML format which is a pretty easy format to write by hand format Seabright like <code>title:</code> in the name of your postsYou could give it a different date then say the timestamp on the file and Sonsie can have edited your post to be square your file becomes assorted combination of content and then metadata talk so in your folder you may have tenant told posts and at that pointThat content is sort of devoid of any layout or visualYou haven't really made seasons about your CSS reset look like then but the rest of your sort of site folderYou can create CSS files you can add your images or whatever assets you want to Load and so the last piece is the layout folder that you create and what Jekyll will do Is it will go Into your layouts folder and basically can use any of those layouts basically wraparound your blog posts there's some additional sort of interesting pieces to Jekyll that this sort of core idea that your content is split out into individual files which contain content metadata and I got a clutch layouts and other tools thatSort of describe patterns for putting together a webpage so how much is this sort of like using Dreamweaver back in the day or I just discovered recently that code cable tool that is constantly has its own kit languageKid filesystem where I can like using PHP include your something where instead of building one channel file for each page I'm buildingSort of one file at the top of HTML is call the header information creation of one file that's footer in this sort of middle that the content and then I can make a whole bunch of noodles andCook it or used to Dreamweaver Dreamweaver libraries you would hit save and it was sort of in one place in the file would say oh you need to suck in the contents of this other file places here in the regenerateIs it that or if you're looking away more superpowers natter neededHim I say it's both feel very familiar to people Renovah been using PHP for templating her better out of wedlock enough toGo all the way back to court fusionAt sort of basic content around template includes loops within those files referencing otherAssets these are all like very familiar constructs that you're going to find in Jekyll another static site generators there's nothingCrazy different about it and say the main difference between working on sort of a modern CMS type of website and working on ecstaticStatic generator website is what you'reWhat sort of you explain what you're building four is the content and the sort of final output of the website you're not trying to cater to individual requests from users coming in dynamically against the website.

So that he also feels like there's a bit more in the Jekyll world ofConsciousness around that that file with the blog post to say is just the content withThe bare minimum formatting typically written marked up using markdownSurveys the same is going to be at house is the headline here's the paragraph you're not saying here's the blue sidebar with the green letters andAnd that may be a little bit six of those files are very very good there's nothing in there but the blog post there's noNone of the rest of HML that wanted in the end does that seem right to you that there is kind of a consciousness around when standards and the need to keep things separated in the Jekyll kind ofWorld that's getting created these days?


Yeah the content stored in the Jekyll posts is very similar To the content you would put in the database of the CMS where if it's Trubel you're creating a note that has certain number fields for metadata and then a body content on that that's basically the markup that you're talking about the structure of the individual content post and not stored separated from the actual layout you're going to present the content in Jekyll preserves that kind of template in andAs I was talking about this differently when too so posted merely going to a blog post template that might have a sidebar in the Mac and go to default template that would add to sitewide navigation on top it keeps everything separate and actually one of the benefits of this too is that it's very easy to iterate on design you can create new layouts and changes just as quickly as great new HML template file and then you can test it out see if that's what you want there isn't really any certain server-side code configuration or additional models when you get plugged in iterate Mrs. again really useful for the product of mentioned previously how's healthcare.govWhen you're working for spots of templates ready just test across many different platforms and devices and screen sizes

So then what about landing page kind of Easy to imagine forcible blog where each contentFile is a page of what aboutThe things that I reallyFelt powerful about using a big CMS is the ability to quicklyThose that can do it visit the village and create separate lists and little blocks modules of content that haveTeasers or thumbnails or you know more if you like this thing maybe like these other things to and being able to grab content out of multiple out of the database multiple times need that sort of the canonical pages got them articled and Emily's wedding pages all sort of teasers and previews and content all over the place how, how can somebody do that using the system Jekyll that something that's possible?


Yeah this is where jekyll gets really interesting so in addition to taking your content rendering an layoutAnd presentation of files Jekel actually manages in memory all the content for your site so this means you can grade a post and just call it inHTML and you can iterate over every single post your site so this is how you can iterate over posted by reverse call oncology and get the last 10 posts of your blog for instanceYou can like conditionals and say I want to post that are tagged blog as the title or posted have hero as the tag on that doesn't be the feature post that we want to have on the homepageSo there's a templating engine built in the deck Jackelyn is a something called liquid which is basically series of tags that you put in your HTML and you can before Luke's if statements there's a number of filters you can change the case or manipulate strings just testing to you would do PHP or I'll build to you in the templates again the real key here you can be on the fact of the contents not be stored in the database is that you do all the processing for your siteWhen you're actually writing content not won a contest being served everything is a rebates offered right based operations that every this means what's your website is generated you can publish it into any SQL Server now can be on FTP that has web accessible front under you can put it up in the CDN directly and then there's just no server-side application that has to keep up with all the traffic is nothing to scale when your server gets really popular except for just basically serving the simplest form of a Chanel and CSS related web asset files

Yeah I mean that's exactly what the main advantaged is I think is the sum scalability and just kind of built into the system… went to go eat us to stand up to talk to traffic on like a big CMS of the database and this becomes really simple to as you have described to have a directory and in the director you have folders and files and that your site there’s no application to set up there’s no database to configure you want to move the site site you can just hand folder over someone or you can check it out from getting with you as we usually do and how this change the workflow it’s very similar for those of you with get with how you develop actual code project whereby everyone on our team when I want to write a blog post just checked out the copy of the entire site works on the blog posts and then check it back in the day and then regenerates the site for you get actually has Jekyll built in so you can just check in those rock template files and content files think it’ll get Hubble on at liberty station I’ll serve that publicly says a very simple workflow the dependencies of very simply can basically have ruby installed in a couple of gems that are extensions of Ruby for running the site so good I mean that’s one thing this A bit fascinating of a confusing I think for users that wrapping your head around it start with that dreamweaver or Code Kit it or whatever building webpages locally sort of the old school back in unit 1997 new building website using Dreamweaver some other tool use including stuff this piece got built locally so when you’re done you had those pages right there on your own particular computer and then you push them so it was in need to be working in a development environment you need to be kind of in Dreamweaver or in whatever tool you’re using where nothing really awesome person in there many years world out there was the most awesome thing ever and when Tim Berners-Lee versus them to the web the first web browser had an editor in it like a deal was you were just going to read you’re going to make and everyone was going to make a website everyone is going to learn Dreamweaver everybody was going to learn how to use these tools and it sort of not really worked out that way so one of the things I think I’ve been seeing when people build Jekyll sizes the script that runs those or are robots the runaround when robots run around and build the pages they’re not doing so but each page request with her doing it with new content is created so it might be local but they might be up on your server and they might be your saying I’ll get a hug because get hub has those running the ability to tell Jekyll files or files using Jekyll on get hug and I’ll get hub Pages platform so talk about what that is and what it means you know what if you want not using good having you just using your own kid in the unknown to local development of our you want everything to be compiled on server-side so you run Ruby on your server install Jekyll and you just have it run how does that work?

So it's it's just a program that you run install the binary file just joking to install any other program that you're just going to execute on your server you really don't need to know anything about Ruby to be running jackal which is actually kind of nice because people can just pick up and start blogging on the project that we put together just by learning market that's the lowest. Entry to our postman if you want to edit the template and you learn HTML structures and liquid which is formatting engine for the HTML so it’s to set up Jackley just install ruby is the development environment you install Jekyll at the gym and he is running the command line just Jekel build or Jekyll served I know what you try to do with it there’s that need to write server-side code because all jackals going to do is read your dirt directories picture files get your content file tablet files and then generate them in the output directory which is the HTML and other related assets that you and I just copy on your Web server so as it is with the get of work flow this just means you push all those and put files recommended and could have been could have automatically generated site for you by out of running check on their service you can do this locally I just top your files into every like to serve them and we also put together an open-source project called Jekyll hook which we released a couple weeks ago as part of the healthcare.gov project and just to know just certainly can have running rerun of Princeton on ACTU and it's running all the time in Alanna time there's a change if you have the servers notified it runs Jekyll for you and then it just executes a shell scripts and move the content where do you want toner case that’s using S3 EC2 copy over Amazon S3 and other projects

I could be using arson to move to a different server so it sounds like there is a little bit of like to set up a server in a certain way or using tools are you setting up for you using running a got also for you but it doesn’t sound any harder than setting up the server for CMS

yeah I think we should really focus on the role github has played in enabling this technology for everything I need a person of the projects we’ve done in the last two years all we do is design the site and we check into a giver hub repository and return over access up I’ll storage him acclimated program that were working with and it’s that simple get hub automatically runs Jekyll for updates we don’t really have two have any long-term maintenance for not running the servers get hubs providing that is part of the service you get that with the basic plan that you get to get hub as a basal service where this gets more interesting is when you want to actually have content editors create new content ready to existing content without needing to check out the code locally to their you know like a wet interface that you get through CMS or you can just go to/admin on your website could you contact and for that we put together another open-source project that actually is it self self hosted on get out it’s called prose minutes please glia content editing interface for the posting get it just uses get hugs 89 allows you to view all the files in your site click on one opening up crate whatever change you want and then take a preview if you like and then create a commitment to save directly into get out to the whole workflow can be in decentralized and if you really kind of the brace the culture and the workflow they could have set up it becomes very easy to get started I think much easier lower bird entry than the traditional sense for CMS’s

So I want to talk extensively about content editors on nerds adding content to sites like this but first just want to sounds like liquid is really like that’s really where you have to start learning perhaps to do simple blog something to be very easy but to do more complicated site that’s got Lynn pages that are designed this way you’re going to rebuild it is going to need liquid and get into what is and is not possible using liquid yes
 That’s right but the sort of really the lowest common denominator for Jekyll site is Axa quite the way I started using Jekyll was a couple years ago I was doing credit size for redesign of our website and at the time I didn’t have any opinions about what sort of system where you such a sketchy things out and nation on CSS flat files and a certain point I have some prototypes and people were ready start developing on it and we talked about looking at jackals one of the options for part of site and it turns out that static site in a index a Chanel file landing page 13 page or blog or a magazine style landing page is all like if you start writing Jackelyn a folder that has a source files you have a legitimate Jekyll site on your hands there is no need to use any of the templating and Jekyll there’s no need using the post of the layout all Jekyll do in the case were you happy files is all set oh you got us accept already like here it is so handed back to you and then the first thing you may do and when you’re for landing pages okay I’ve got this lighting Pagemont that has these five top blog posts or five recent blog posts or five featured pieces of content and right now I just have to sort of copy and paste this more medicine into the spot would be nice if I could in the spot have five post actually connected to my contact rectory in that little spot right on urination I’ll file drop in a liquid for loop that looks for those posts you got that content and Emily coming from your host directory server the nice thing about Jekyll that before it’s very friendly for people who are in love with standards because if you learned HTML and CSS and JavaScript right when a writing that content by hand for prototypes or mockups like you're already there right the most important part of your site is done and you can slowly and P Spikeys start insert the sort of loops and includes as you want and you don’t have to sort commit to a full sort of a full switch over if you want to put it that way so that’s how I actually got started and that was actually on the most sort of surprising things for me was that coming from a CMS background where you kind of have to commit to learning the whole stack top to bottom that was the case at all I sort of know the first time to learn Lakotas before loop and I used it exactly for one thing and then everything else I Prototyping and flat additional CSS JavaScript and if the project didn’t need any more complexity than I probably would’ve stopped right there.

yeah to Justin prototype and have been doing a lot more design prototypes and code and it does have flashbacks the 90s and I start realizing this and the tools that are used to Lynn the 90s I'm walking back because here I am and I've got three pages of put it text whatever and make a change on one of them and I want to make cutting pasting making a change across all three with me to change the footer to make the change the footer in three places at the next thing I know I’ve got 12 pages of other types and man making sure that it’s the same footer all the way across cutting and pasting like this is getting to be a real waste of time you’re wanting to get one change the navigation and the prototype and suddenly I can cut-and-paste it across the whole file size that’s a think we’re starting our kitten Colkitt I just need to kind of but it feels like Jekyll phone the same kind of need and being able to extract out some of the details of the site and have things in one file to multiple files like you don’t have to steaks get making changes his tools might be something people might want to use the text Yan it’s a great way to get started and that’s exactly what Jekyll is enabling you to do the nice thing about using Jekyll or another staff generator is this kind is it that you're starting with the absolute least amount of work that you need to do you're not configuring and setting up and installing a pastry application you can type me not cut-and-paste things back-and-forth packet loss I think you're just taking the things that need to be reusing putting them in a folder called include you taking the things that will format the lamb putting them put another folder called out to take the content wasn’t putting up and up folder called post they just want a program that is what you have all the individual files physically or site for you in some ways reminds me of sassier from people of use make the switch from writing raw CSS in a regular CSS file to using something like sass where the heart is thing is just switching your brain and setting up slightly different Roman environment and but you have to actually have to write anything in any stressful sass format but then you can use a little bit here in a little bit then the next thing you know it’s six of us later using all over the place he can’t remember how you ever do that didn’t use it right and usually wouldn’t actually serve the sass files to the browser right you converted back to CSS or not and I throw the Jack was playing yet what you doing what’s literally the same and not you’re running Ruby scripts that looks for your son’s files sees that their changes and compile them and CSS files for you if you want to change the production format looking up format using only want to switch from to bellman to production code you know you to make one change the config file then put them you got all your CSS remaining in production for my incident about the format and in that way I think it’s very similar in that it’s the script that runs and looks for certain files and when it sees a presence of those files creates other files and those other files and files within humans don’t touch instead of her and CSS files suit humans rule is human you don’t ever edit the results of Jekyll running a smell files you only edit the source files for the site yet exactly because if you doing position I’ll output files Regenerator site change to get overwritten yet there’s an essay question chat about formats this is a good way to keep the format separate as you can write your content in markdown or textile or some very lightweight format that’s really easy for people to learn that if you want to make a complete cost well we do this sometimes for a blog if we have a feature product of something I’m needs to just look really good you can just write the post complete HTML and they’re taking it smells and couldn’t HTMLs output the differences you still get the temp putting an extra layer layouts that you get if you’re using markdown or another format are you also able to have Jekyll make use of this before but different output see you have content number one and you’re sitting into the website but on the other hand into an IOS application are making out and I’ll send it to an RSS feed else is sending it to some other kind of API that you have that other websites that are related to you are pulling your content in from the AVI is that something that Jekyll is happy to do yeah so then other thing about something about chuckles not at all opinionated about your output format so for example the output format is pretty much undetermined in Jekyll if you decide to have a file that’s called.html and it happens have HML that it’s having a template things into that but if you decide to name the file.CSS and you actually want to use the content of your posts influence what your CSS looks like and want to use liquid logic in that Side inflows that you can do that as well so we kind of embraces aspect of Jekyll pretty aggressively so we have ever Friday of projects where the main output is Jason or the main outputted maybe Jason plus RSS feed alongside of it so it’s quite flexible not regarding think the sort of way to think of Jekyll sort of big pictures that it’s it’s a converter to compiler from your sort of raw patterns that you decided that are important to capture content your layouts and it’s a converter compiler turn that into the final product that you’re going to deliver to your users or to the applications that are integrating with your API or website or something like that yeah let’s just start with some real quick examples back I think it’s a really neat way to build so first of your training RSS feed for your blog just as you use the posts List Chiteric through and create HTML layout for your post it instead of wrapping those postinvasion I’ll you’re just wrapping in XML structure of RSS content on RSS when you can have an RSS feed ready to go as you mention you can also create Jason APS services on healthcare site Eversoll posterization else also available Jason so just write a simple template that takes the values that you information about some switches over to the HTML so the really’s enabled is a performance just by kind of coming up rid of wishes the template is that something was the main motivation for Duval receipts situated from Drupal to something like this last him I’d say there were a lot of there were a lot of reasons that moved off of Drupal and I think and we didn’t really know like what all those reasons were the time but Jekyll has definitely been sort of an eye-opening experience for us our team and it continues to be even two or three years later now especially this summer even have been really impressed with we have a lot of new people on our team that don’t necessarily have to pick up a technical background but one of the things that people are to learn to come here is a basic agent on CSS instead blog and how to write well and just get up and collaborate with other people and the barrier to entry is just so low for someone to come in and pull together a new site or really strong blog posts do not need a no any SQL they don’t need to learn any system there to learn the court web technologies left to take I’m really far on the source systems you have to resume up to a little higher level and just try think about the role display it’s really a philosophical shift more than a technology shift when we first moved off of Jekyll or Simon first move off of Drupal there’re two kinds of the mountain tried to happen one we started building really custom data heavy visualization tools that he’s no just service to generate these issues I’ll output and that was that was kind of the direct predecessor to what we’re doing in Drupal Mercury news data heavy Drupal sites just not being it would make them scale it is faster spots as we like is there so much configuration and other things going on the Drupal site this wasn’t made a frozen data if you have 1 million records and points are going to put on table or map it doesn’t need to be translated to a node in a content database so the idea of creating this note applications no gas applications seem to make a lot of sense on the other hand we just needed to have really lightweight pages and times of making features. In fact visualization using a single template to wrap around it some about text legend some other information that was just.html so our first project the guys were coming I just started here was a map about disaster relief projects nearest of there quick in Japan and it was just an HML site in bed point from actually got so suck it up so let’s get back to basics just replaced plantation out a child CSS by hand message products aren’t scaly went to the directions Notework became kind of the core of the back box occasions and still server-side application but with these kind of custom servers server applications regenerating ABI’s mostly Jason APIs or other data feeds that front out applications to seeing for but for course site building inspector be six just trading HML then we needs downgrade a few more pages of each amounts of just one use the light is waiting you can to create this template so not cases the converter like Jekyll we can just scale up the content without having to replicate your templates and your laugh over the place so it’s this is a paradigm shift as much as was a total technology shift wasn’t the case that we decided that we are done at your Walmart started building check the sites were done with Drupal because I couldn’t do the data visualization as skill we needed and it required a lot of overhead for me configuration is going the direction of her more on this project and our work was taking us at the same time for just want to build a quick website you know even made it to sweating website or personal website for friend you know you don’t need to encumber them with an entire CMS to make at 7:30 going back to basics there and I think what we’ve been able to do not ever moving forward. It will change a stack of services and things that are out there for people to use this methodology recruiting some static sites to the point were you can get it at scale and size of you were doing before.
